# Final Book Project
#### Project Members: Alexander Ernst
##### I hope for my final book project to be a piece of art, making use of new techniques I havenâ€™t worked with before, and ultimately being an interactive and though provoking work. 
#####  The book will be made from white paper, and the text is in wax or latex such that the negative space must be filled before the text becomes legible.
### Content
I know that I want there to be an ending to this book, whatever that may be. Even if the ending of the book hasn't been uncovered yet, I still want the content that's readable to be enjoyable. For this reason I'm thinking of writing a short story with illustrations dispersed throught the pages as well. A theme that I think could be explored well in this format is darkness vs. light.
### Format
This book will be made of white paper with at least a weight similar to the paper we printed in class, like postcard paper. It needs to have some weight to it so that  ink or market wont bleed through. I would like if the book had a spine as well, possibly made of the same paper fortified.
### Skills Needed
I possess all the skills I need, and will only need to test my means of producing an individual page which I will bring to class to show I'm on the right track for the prototype stage.
### Materials
I need to buy weighted paper, an exacto knife, paintbrushes, wax and latex, and the rest can be mocked up on a computer. The consistancy of the wax is the only uncertainty in this process, but I will talk to the employees at Blick to get tehir oppinion when I go to buy the rest of these materials there.
### Evaluation
Most importantly the art process has to work correctly so that the text in the book is legible. Legibility is important in this project. The book should also not fall apart. Reading this book is ephemeral in nature, since once you color a page to make the text legible, you can't really undo it. I want this book to be like an installation so that multiple people can uncover diferent parts of the text, even though none of them may get to read the full text. It's interactive. This book should look like a novel that has all its text bleached at first, pristine, and in the end should be worn out through all the processes that have been done to it. I would also say that at a minimum it should have 20 pages to it, but I'm open to that number changing based on how quickly the construction of an individual page goes.
