_Etheric ocean_ by J. R. Carpenter was the most eclectic eBook of the readings, combining shifting text, sounds and music, and video to create one immersive experience. I t reminded me more of an experimental art project than a book even though it doesnâ€™t meet the definition, but just because it's a book that doesn't mean it conveyed information in the most effective way. In fact, there were parts of this book that conveyed information well together, such as the linking of audio files and text describing them.
Early versions of eBooks on floppy disks and Hypercards resemble modern zine distribution in that they were numbered and distributed selectively to a small group. 
_The deletionist_ by Amaranth Borsuk, Jesper Juul, and Nick Montfort might be my favorite thing I've discovered in this class. It's a "book" that alters the text of the page you're on by deleting words. I have never seen technology have this effect before while not navigating to its own page and displaying its own content, but using the text on the page you're on.
