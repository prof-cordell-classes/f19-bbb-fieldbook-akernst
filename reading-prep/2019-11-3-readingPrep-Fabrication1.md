1. Is 3D printed literature anything other than the resurgence of the earliest forms of writing (clay tablets, later clay spherical books, etc.) through accessible modern technology?
2. Where is the transition between something like MashBOT and a poetry book, in terms of "3D printing"? Both are poems printed on paper, however one is randomized and continuous, and the other is standardized and distributed. Is the distinction in the fact that the object printed is singular and contained as one object? Or is that simply up to the creator?
3. One of the points that sticks with me when discussing 3D printed replicas of objects is how little they capture of the original object. An entirely new object is being created in the current moment in time, and thus cannot capture the history of the object it was based off of. The new object may have the form of the old one, but cannot have its aura, its place in time and history, etc.
