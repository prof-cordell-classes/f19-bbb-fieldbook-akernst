1. Besides holding and smelling a book, are there ways to create new material experiences from it without destroying the book in some way?
2. Is it possible to separate the designing aspect of a book when using letterpress or are they inherently connected due to the need to arrange the letters in the press?
3. Just like text is bound, how is other media organized and kept together, physically and not? How does the size or quantity of physical text or books affect their ability to kept together and distributed?

Another point of interest is how the appearance of a book (including its binding) can be of more interest than the content, and how this relates to the famous saying, "donâ€™t judge a book by its cover."
