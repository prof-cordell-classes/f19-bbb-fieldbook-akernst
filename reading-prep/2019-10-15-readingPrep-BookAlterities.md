Does a book cease to exist when it can no longer be read? and is physically destroyed? Or does the book still persist in other ways like through memory, or under what circumstances would a book be considered to be no more?

Is Lisa Vollrath's definition of altered books limiting by suggesting that they can only be created from _printed_ books?
And if not what does that say about books created from other materials?

All the different types of book alterities presented in the readings depend on time: time for the organism to replicate, time for trees to grow, time for books to be created first so that they may be repurposed.
