For Pagan Kennedy, the change in her writing medium, from fiction novels to zines, seemed to allow for her allowed her to communicate differently and express herself in new ways.

Why are zines content often considered "highly personal" (as noted in Zine Librarians Code of Ethics)? Why are they any more personal then a book?

I hadn't considered the effects of having digital media and zines a click away from interacting with someone about them. Especially when those interactions are negative, that for me is enough reason to value physical zines and reading them in solitude.
